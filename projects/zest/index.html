  		          <p>Fourth Year | Spring 2019<br>05-392 Interaction Design Overview<br>Professors: Rita Lee, Shelley Moertel</p>
  		          <h3>Introduction</h3>
  		          <p>Our app focuses on learning and teaching how to cook. Unlike a lot of current apps in this domain that mainly share recipes, our app would provide people with classes for cooking either through videos or in-person meetups. We want to create a platform where people can interact more and learn more comfortably and quickly. In addition, any user would be able to learn but also teach, because these users, by default, are the experts regarding their own particular recipe. After extensive research and iteration, we designed an app for cooking that combines written, visual, physical and auditory methods of learning and teaching.</p>
  		          <p>In collaboration with Joseph Pang, Ji Soo Geum, and Rachel Park. </p>

  		            <h2>Research</h2>
  		            <p>Our research utilized a 3-part interview process. The first round of interviews was a general interview asking people about learning experiences. The second round of interviews was asking people about learning specific to cooking. The last round of interviews was asking people about teaching how to cook.</p>
  		            <p>We found that most people learned best through personal interaction and that there needs to be more thorough steps when learning or teaching someone. By interviewing people, we were able to create the content of our app.</p>

  		              <p>George is a manager at Whole Foods who is looking to expand his grocery store’s sales by encouraging people to cook. As a result, he has decided to invest in an app, Zest, that is a one-stop shop for all how-to cooking needs. He wants the app to provide something different from the current cooking apps and Youtube videos so that the app can distinguish itself from the oversaturated market. According to his own cooking experience, George knows that personal interaction and individualized learning is the most helpful way for successful cooking. As a result, George wants to expand from simply sharing cooking tips and recipes and create a community that anyone of various skill levels can learn and teach how to cook.</p>

As a result, he advertises the use of Zest by hosting in-person cooking classes, which is a feature of Zest.</p>

  		          <p>Overall, our users only had trouble with 1 major thing; they were confused about where to go to create/share a recipe versus a class. The "Create" button at the top right corner of the screen that was meant for creating and sharing a recipe mislead our users. However, when directed to the "Me" page, it was easy for our users to create an event for teaching a cooking class. As a result, we’ve decided to reword our buttons.</p>
