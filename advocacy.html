          <h2>Designing Activism</h2>
          <p>A podcast created out of the passion to increase awareness of “empty activism”, its underlying causes and adverse effects, and how to participate in actionable and tangible advocacy. An AIAS Advocacy initative, created and hosted by yours truly!</p>

            </ul>
            <p>This special episode is a compilation of three short interviews with Carnegie Mellon University 5th year B.Arch students in the Thesis program. We quickly discuss their projects and how Thesis has been an avenue to advocate for their passions and interests. Interviewing in three different places is hard! Please excuse the audio changes. </p>
            <p>I am aware that because this episode was recorded 2-3 weeks ago, it doesn't address the current COVID-19 situation in the world. I hope you all are safe, washing your hands, and doing okay! </p>

            <p>Social responsibility has become a huge differentiator in the marketplace. As both consumers and companies are becoming more and more mindful of their carbon footprint, advocacy for more sustainable practices and products is particularly important now.

            </ul>
            <p>Historically, athletes, brands and sports leagues take different positions on whether or not to accomodate and address political and social issues. What are the underlying forces at play that impact the effectiveness of taking a stand? And why are the consequences of advocacy in this field often negative or controversial?

            <h4>4. How Can Designers Be Activists?</h4>

            </ul>
            <p>How can designers be activists? On this episode, join Alina Kramkova, Chitika Vasudeva, and me in discussing the activism that is inherent to design and design-affiliated professions.</p>
            <p>How can you consciously channel your career and daily life as a designer to advocate for issues that matter? How can designers and architects use their unique perspective and expertise to help advance larger advocacy initiatives? Can you prevent yourself from falling into ‘empty activism’? Though we don’t have the answer to all of these questions, we do have some ideas about how the designers of tomorrow can be activists today.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Chitika (recurring guest) and I hit a topic a little closer to home — current advocacy efforts and how to become an effective advocate within the American Institute of Architecture Students (AIAS). What projects and efforts are currently being undertaken by the organization? Who is working on these and how do you get involved? Hear updates from Scott Cornelius (Oklahoma State University) and Amber Kustaborder (Kent State University) about their recent efforts regarding rewriting and redefining Studio Culture Policies (or Learning and Teaching Culture Policies).</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Chitika Vasudeva (recurring 'character'/guest) and I speak about the presence of social media activism and the concept of spreading advocacy efforts via the Internet.</p>
            <p>When is social media considered a form of empty activism? How many people even took the time to research the issue they're posting about? Join us as we criticize and take some of the blame when it comes to ineffectively spreading the word through social media. Though sparking conversation about a topic can be beneficial, what comes before the trending topic and the actions taken after the topic has passed can be the most essential examples of effective advocacy.</p>

            <p>Three special guests: Tim Hawk, FAIA, Chitika Vasudeva (CMU AIAS), and Ethan Moore (KSU AIAS) join me on a discussion about their various avenues to advocacy, as well as a reflection on Student Capitol Hill Day. </p>
