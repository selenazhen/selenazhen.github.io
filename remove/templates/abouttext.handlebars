<p>I’m currently a student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree in Architecture as well as a passion for the beauty of experience and detail. I strongly believe in the process of design and its applications to situations outside of architecture and design, and am looking forward to ways I can improve human experience, expand my skillset, and develop new methods of approach to design.</p>
